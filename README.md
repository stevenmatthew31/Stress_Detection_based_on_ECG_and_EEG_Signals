## Stress Detection based on ECG and EEG Signals
Based on a survey by the American Psychological Association, more than half of America's population has reported stress as a source of health problems as well as the 2018 Indonesian Basic Health Research, showing more than 19 million people experience emotional stress disorders, and more than 12 million people experience depression.

## Backgrounder
Stress is a natural response to challenges, but it can have negative effects on mental and physical health when it becomes excessive. Stress detection aims to identify and manage stress-related issues effectively. Techniques include physiological measures such as heart rate and cortisol levels, wearable technology, and AI-based analysis. Applications for stress detection systems include healthcare, workplace wellness, and mental health support. Privacy and ethical considerations are essential when developing stress detection systems.

## Introduction
Discrete Wavelet Transform is used for ECG signals so as to get the desired features (HRV). Band Pass Filter is also applied to filter the EEG signal. HRV and EEG signal feature extraction is carried out into 11 features and applying an Artificial Neural Network to get the stress level. There are 3 levels of stress

## Target Market
Helping people identify and manage their stressors such as victims of bullying, etc
